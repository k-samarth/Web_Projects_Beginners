        Header 1:
        <h1>
            <!--h1 is the highest Header tag-->
            This is Header 1
        </h1>
        Header 2:
        <h2>
            <!--h2 has lesser strength than h1-->
            This is Header 2
        </h2>
        Header 3:
        <h3>
            <!--h3 has lesser strength than h2-->
            This is Header 3
        </h3>
        Header 4:
        <h4>
            <!--h4 has lesser strength than h3-->
            This is Header 4

        Header 5:
        <h5>
            <!--h5 has lesser strength than h4-->
            This is Header 5
        </h5>
        Header 6:

            <!--h6 has lesser strength than h5-->
            This is Header 6
        </h6>
        
        Now let us see what will happen if we mix 2 Tags
        <h1>
            We opened the tag with h1 and closed it with /h6
        </h6>
        <h1>
            <h6>
                We have enclosed h6 tag inside h1
            </h6>
        </h1>
        <h1>We did not close h1 tag

            ---::::---This is next line
